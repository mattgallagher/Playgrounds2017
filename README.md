# Playgrounds2017

This is code that I used in my talk at [Playgrounds](http://www.playgroundscon.com) in February 2017.

It reuses code from one of my blog articles, "[Random number generators in Swift](https://www.cocoawithlove.com/blog/2016/05/19/random-numbers.html)", broken down into a series of steps, investigating how to get from a "naive" C-to-Swift conversion to a version that has equal (or better) performance.

To use this project, open the xcodeproj file and run the Tests.

For my talk, I ran all tests on a Mac Pro 5,1 @ 2.66Ghz; other devices will get different performance results.

I'll update with a video to the talk when it becomes available.
